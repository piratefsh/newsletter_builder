Basic Newsletter Builder
==================

Simple form for creating newsletters on a given template. Currently only fixed to one template in ce_template folder.
Originally built for the Greater University Tutoring Service (GUTS), UW-Madison's CE Program newsletter to simplify the newsletter editing process for staff unfamiliar with HTML/CSS. 

Also, existing webmail editor always messed up CSS when any changes were made in it. 

Future Plans
==================
<ul>
  <li> Allow for generic templates</li>
  <li> Live preview</li>
  <li> Write own tool for converting external CSS to inline CSS</li>
</ul>

Built With
